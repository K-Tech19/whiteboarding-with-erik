Welcome back to Whiteboarding with Erik, where every week I break down one problem from data structures, algorithms, and general head-scratchers into clean, easy-to-understand solutions. 

I currently work as a TA at a coding bootcamp, and I love my students. Over the course of twelve weeks, they're expected to go from very little or no coding experience to having published three full stack web apps. They grow up so fast! (I'm not just joking, it's really extraordinary and I'm proud of you all). But week one is a doozy, especially for those who had almost no JavaScript experience, and are thrown into it at full force.

Well, for me, it was certainly interesting when I didn't understand that *Java*, which I learned at university, is a completely different language from *JavaScript*, which is the language for pretty much all front end web development. "Wow!" I thought to myself on week one. "There sure have been a lot of updates since I learned 'JavaScript'!" (admissions people, \*please\* take notice). But, the fact that I had a good foundation of CS principles really helped. Once you understand the theory behind well implemented, clean code, learning a new language is just a matter of taking the old one and giving it some new pants. Or a hat. Some sort of similar metaphor. 

This is what we're going to do today. Some of you may have seen this problem, a very tricky JS problem that is sometimes given as homework in the first week. By now, you may not think it so difficult, but when you first started, it may have seemed quite daunting. Today, we'll quickly walk through the solution in JS, and then, I'll show you how to convert it to Python. Hopefully this will give you some insight in this "pants trick" I just described, i.e. how to take the same concepts and reapply them in a new language. 

Let's look at the problem: 

	# A number is pandigital if it has digits 1-n for a number 
	  n digits long.
	# Given a number, return whether or not it is pandigital.
	
First we have to get over the problem of "What the heck does pandigital mean?" The prompt states a number, presumably an integer, can be called pandigital if it has digits 1-N for a number N digits long. Meaning, if a number is 5 digits long, it must contain the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Here's some sample output: 

	print(is_pandigital(321))
	# -> True
	print(is_pandigital(123465))
	# -> True
	print(is_pandigital(12765))
	# -> False
	
### Solution #1: JavaScript

First of all, we'll define a method `isPandigital()` that takes in one argument, the number, which we'll call `num`.

	function isPandigital(num) {
	}
	
Next, let's think about the solution. We have to compare digits, which is entirely possible to do while keeping the number as an integer. However, it will take a lot of math, i.e. separating the digits using a compination of division and mod operations. For instance, if we have 1234 and we want to get the 2, we would call `num  % 1000` to get the last 3 digits, and then use `Math.floor(num/100)` to get rid of the 3 and 4. This isn't impossible, but it may seem like a lot if you just learned to code and don't have a math-heavy background. 

Instead, we can do something which probably sounds familiar if you've been following my blog, we're going to convert the number into a String and then into a list of characters. This way, we can easily compare the digits. 

Here's how we do that in JavaScript:

	function isPandigital(num) {
		num = num.toString().split("");
	}
	
Yes, there's a method in JavaScript called `toString()` that parses other types into a String. A similar method called `parseInt()` changes a string into its integer equivalent. Then, we call the `.split()` method, which separates a string with along the divider character, passed as an argument. We'll pass an empty string, which tells JavaScript to give each character its own spot in the array. You can try to console log `num` on the next line to see what it looks like, which should be something like `123` => `['1', '2', '3']`.

There are a couple ways you could go from here, but for the solution I'll cover, let me ask you something. Would this problem be easier if the number were sorted? If we have a number 123, we know exactly what it would have to look like if it were pandigital– each digit counting up from 1. It would look the same every time, whether we started with 321 or 213, etc. JavaScript has a `.sort()` method similar to Python, so we'll sort the array and resave it to the `num` variable. I'll concatenate this to the previous line. 

	function isPandigital(num) {
		num = num.toString().split("").sort();
	}
	
I had several students get to this point, and everything looked good so far. Next, they were ready to loop through the characters and check each one for the proper value. Given a sample number like 123465789, they made and array like so:

	arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
	
Once the number they were given was sorted, they just had to loop through it to see if each digit matched this array. This solution works, since a digit in base 10 can only go up to 9. However, there's a simpler solution. In our sorted array, each item has an index that starts at 0 and goes to the length minus one. Each item is its index plus one. So, all we need to do is loop through the array and check for that:

	for (let i=0; i < num.length; i++) {
	     if (num[i] != i+1) {
	       return false;
	     }
	   } 

If the number at the index is not equal to the index plus one, we return `false` because the number is not pandigital. Otherwise, if we make it through the whole array and find no problems, we'll return true. Altogether:

*isPandigital.js*

	function isPandigital(num) {
	  num = num.toString().split("").sort();
	  console.log(num);
	  for (let i=0; i < num.length; i++) {
	    if (num[i] != i+1) {
	      return false;
	    }
	  }
	  return true;
	}

And that's it for JavaScript. If you console log the return value of `isPandigital(12345)`, you should get `true`. 

### Solution 2: Python

Converting the solution shouldn't be too difficult, since we already have the problem solved and working. All that's left is a few differences in JS and Python syntax. You can try rewriting the code line by line, or start from scratch. 

The function declaration is a simple syntax difference, we get rid of the word `function` and add a `def`, semicolons and brackets are going to peace out, etc. 

	def is_pandigital(num):
		pass

If you remember, we started by converting the number into a string. Python has typecasting methods that simply involve taking the type and putting parentheses around it:

	def is_pandigital(num):
		num = str(num)
	
Now we'll make a list of each character in the string. I've said it in previous posts, and I'll say it again: this comes up a lot, and you should try to know it by heart. Does this look familiar: `[char for char in s]`? The inline `for` loop returns a character for each character in the string, and the brackets cast those values into a list. This is how it will look to separate each digit:

	def is_pandigital(num):
		num = [digit for digit in str(num)]

Next, we want to sort the list. For JavaScript, we called `.sort()` and reassigned it to the `num` variable:

	num = num.sort()
	
If you try this in Python, you might notice something strange happened. 

	>>> num = [2,3,1,4]
	>>> num = num.sort()
	>>> print(num)
	None

Now our list is equal to `None`! This is because the `.sort()` methods in Python and JavaScript are a little different. JavaScript *returns* a sorted version of the list, and Python *alters* the original list, and has no return value. So, we just have to call `.sort()` without reassigning `num`. 

	num.sort()
	
Next, we iterate over the list. To loop through each index in a list, instead of each value, we use the `range()` function and pass it the length of the list. 

 	for i in range(len(num)):
 	
Finally, we have our `if` statement, which looks largely the same, minus some parentheses and curly braces:

	for i in range(len(num)):
	    if int(num[i]) != (i + 1):
	      return False

Finally, again, we return `True` outside the `for` loop. Remember that `True` and `False` are capitalized in Python. 

	def is_pandigital(num):
	  num = [digit for digit in str(num)]
	  num.sort()
	  print(num)
	  for i in range(len(num)):
	    if int(num[i]) != (i + 1):
	      return False
	  return True
	  
And there you have it! Our method has been successfully converted into Python. You may ask, how did I know that `.sort()` works different in Python, or the method to turn a number into a string is `str()` instead of `toString()`? The answer is, if you don't know, look it up! Googling "cast to string python" should give you something. Apart from that, simply playing around and testing different cases allows for some simple debugging. Just a few tweaks here and there, and our method is fully functional.  

### Solution 3: More Optimal Python
