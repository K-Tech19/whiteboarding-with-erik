# This problem was asked by Amazon.
# Implement a stack that has the following methods:
# 1. push(val), which pushes an element onto the stack
# 2. pop(), which pops off and returns the topmost element of the stack. 
#   If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.
# 3. max(), which returns the maximum value in the stack currently. 
#   If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.
# Each method should run in constant time.
